# Small_program_usingSQLite3

# So this is just something to get me familiar with SQLite3, to understand how it works cause of how widely used it is 

# Just a user test with random questions and it just stores the amount of a certain answer type in the database 
# when you start a program it usually resets the variable definitions to what ever you set them as in the beginning like b = 0 and # every time you start that program b is going to be 0. But with this its accessing the database and making the variables whatever # values are in the database, basically the database doesn't reset after its closed and started thats the point im trying to make 
# and thats the mechanism I benefitted from when using it in this small program. In the future I hope to use SQLite3 again or even  # use mySQL in bigger more expansive program/project
